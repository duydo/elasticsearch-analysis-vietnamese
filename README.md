# Vietnamese Analysis Plugin for Elasticsearch

Vietnamese Analysis plugin integrates Vietnamese language analysis into Elasticsearch. It uses [C++ tokenizer for Vietnamese](https://github.com/coccoc/coccoc-tokenizer) library developed by
CocCoc team for their Search Engine and Ads systems.

The plugin provides `vi_analyzer` analyzer, `vi_tokenizer` tokenizer and `vi_stop` stop filter. The `vi_analyzer` is composed of the `vi_tokenizer` tokenizer and `stop` filter.

## Example output

```
GET /_analyze
{
  "analyzer": "vi_analyzer",
  "text": "công nghệ thông tin việt nam"
}
```
The above sentence would produce the following terms:
```
["công nghệ", "thông tin", "việt nam"]

```

## Configuration

The `vi_analyzer` analyzer accepts the following parameters:

- `dict_path` The path to tokenizer dictionary on system. Defaults to `/usr/share/tokenizer/dicts`.
- `keep_punctuation` Keep punctuation marks as tokens. Defaults to `false`.
- `split_url` If it's enabled (`true`), a domain `duydo.me` is split into  `["duy", "do", "me"]`.
  If it's disabled (`false`) `duydo.me` is split into `["duydo", "me"]`. Defaults to `false`.
  
- `stopwords` A pre-defined stop words list like `_vi_` or an array containing a list of stop words. Defaults to [stopwords.txt](src/main/resources/org/apache/lucene/analysis/vi/stopwords.txt) file. 
- `stopwords_path` The path to a file containing stop words.


### Example configuration
In this example, we configure the `vi_analyzer` analyzer to keep punctuation marks and to use the custom list of stop words:

```
PUT my-vi-index-00001
{
  "settings": {
    "analysis": {
      "analyzer": {
        "my_vi_analyzer": {
          "type": "vi_analyzer",
          "keep_punctuation": true,
          "stopwords": ["rất", "những"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

GET my-vi-index-00001/_analyze
{
  "analyzer": "my_vi_analyzer",
  "text": "công nghệ thông tin Việt Nam rất phát triển trong những năm gần đây."
}
```

The above example produces the following terms:
```
["công nghệ", "thông tin", "việt nam", "phát triển", "trong", "năm", "gần đây", "."]

```
## Build from Source
### Step 1: Build C++ tokenizer for Vietnamese library
```sh
git clone https://github.com/coccoc/coccoc-tokenizer.git
cd coccoc-tokenizer && mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DBUILD_JAVA=1 ..
make install
```

Check their [repo](https://github.com/coccoc/coccoc-tokenizer) for more information to build the library.

### Step 2: Build the plugin

Clone the plugin’s source code:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/duydo/elasticsearch-analysis-vietnamese.git
```

Edit the `elasticsearch-analysis-vietnamese/pom.xml` to change the version of Elasticsearch (same as plugin version) you want to build the plugin with:

```xml
...
<groupId>org.elasticsearch</groupId>
<artifactId>elasticsearch-analysis-vietnamese</artifactId>
<version>7.17.1</version>
...
 ```

Build the plugin:
```sh
cd elasticsearch-analysis-vietnamese
mvn package
```

### Step 3: Installation the plugin on Elasticsearch

```sh
bin/elasticsearch-plugin install file://target/releases/elasticsearch-analysis-vietnamese-7.11.2.zip
```

## Compatible Versions

From version 7.12.11, the plugin uses CocCoc C++ tokenizer instead of the VnTokenizer library (by Lê Hồng Phương),
I won't maintain the plugin with the VnTokenizer anymore. If you want to continue developing with it, you can check branch [vntokenizer](https://github.com/duydo/elasticsearch-analysis-vietnamese/tree/vntokenizer).  

If you want to use the plugin with prior versions of Elasticsearch, you can build the plugin yourself with above guide.
